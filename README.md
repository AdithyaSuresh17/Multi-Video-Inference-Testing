# Multi-Video Inference with VLMs  

This repo explores the use of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for multi-camera surveillance by integrating ESP32-CAM feeds with an LLM-powered chatbot interface. The goal is to enable natural language querying of real-time video footage without traditional object detection models.  

## Features (WIP)  
- **ESP32-CAM Video Streaming** → Cloud integration for multi-camera feeds.  
- **VLM-Powered Video Inference** → Using LLMs to process and describe video.  
- **Chatbot Interface** → Query video feeds using natural language.
